# Web Application Template

Opinionated React + TypeScript starter for product apps that want strong structure, clear boundaries, and good behavior from both humans and coding agents.

## Stack

- Vite
- React 19
- TypeScript
- TanStack Router with file-based routes
- TanStack Query
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui
- Vitest
- Supabase

## What This Template Optimizes For

- Thin route files and feature-first organization
- Strict TypeScript and linting
- Clear query and infrastructure boundaries
- Supabase-ready structure with migrations and Edge Functions
- Repository automation that nudges clean PR and commit hygiene

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app usually runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

If you want Supabase connected in the browser app, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=...
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server
- `npm run build` type-checks and builds the app
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint, Markdown linting, and SQL formatting checks
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally
- `npm run test` runs Vitest and intentionally passes when the starter has no tests yet
- `npm run release:dry` previews the next release version and changelog changes
- `npm run release` creates the release commit and tag, pushes to `main`, and triggers a GitHub Release
- `npm run prepare` installs Husky hooks

## Documentation Map

- `README.md`: human overview, setup, and repository tour
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: human contribution workflow and expectations
- `AGENTS.md`: agent-only working agreement and code organization rules
- `SECURITY.md`: vulnerability reporting and security expectations

If you are contributing as a person, start here and then read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

If you are an agent, `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth.

## Project Structure

```text
src/
  components/
    ui/                  # low-level primitives
    app/                 # app-specific shared components
    shared/              # small reusable cross-feature components
  features/              # feature-owned components, queries, hooks, schemas, utils
  hooks/                 # app-wide reusable hooks
  lib/                   # infrastructure and generic utilities
  routes/                # route files only
  test/                  # shared test setup and helpers
  types/                 # shared domain types
  index.css              # global theme and styles
  main.tsx               # app bootstrap

supabase/
  config.toml            # local Supabase config
  functions/             # Edge Functions
  migrations/            # schema history
  seed.sql               # optional deterministic seed data
```

## Template Conventions

- Keep route files small and move growing logic into `src/features`.
- Import from `src` through the `@/` alias.
- Import features through public entrypoints such as `@/features/<feature-name>`.
- Keep data access in feature query modules instead of routes and components.
- Do not edit generated files such as `src/routeTree.gen.ts` by hand.
- Treat `supabase/migrations` as the source of truth for schema changes.
- Enable Row Level Security on application tables.

## Repository Automation

This template ships automation that downstream projects can keep:

- Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit formatting and linting
- commitlint for conventional commit messages
- on-demand release flow via `npm run release` (version bump, changelog update, release commit, and tag)
- tag-triggered GitHub Release workflow (`.github/workflows/tag-release.yml`)
- GitHub Actions for lint, build, test, dependency review, workflow linting, and CodeQL
- CODEOWNERS and PR governance helpers

## Before Shipping Changes

Run the checks that fit your change:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

If you changed behavior covered by tests, also run `npm run test`.

If you changed schema, also confirm:

- a migration was added in `supabase/migrations`
- RLS and policies were updated when needed
- generated database types were updated if the project uses them
